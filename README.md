# Installation

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

<a name="a2"/>
# Usage/Features

```bash
$ npm install pm2 -g     # Install pm2 command line globally
$ pm2 start app.js -i 4  # Daemonize pm2 and Start 4 clustered instances of app.js
                         # You can also pass the 'max' params to start 
                         # the right numbers of processes depending of CPUs
$ pm2 list               # Display all processes status
$ pm2 monit              # Monitor all processes
$ pm2 logs               # Display all processes logs in streaming
$ pm2 dump               # Dump the states of all processes
$ pm2 stop pm2_id        # Stop specific process id
$ pm2 stopAll            # Stop all processes
$ pm2 resurrect          # Put online previously dumped processes
$ pm2 reload all         # Hot Reload all processes with 0s downtime (only for HTTP)
$ pm2 restart pm2_id     # Restart specific process
$ pm2 restart all        # Hard Restart all proccesses
$ pm2 stop all           # Stop all processes
$ pm2 generate app       # Generate a JSON process configuration
$ pm2 startup            # Generate init script to keep processes alive
$ pm2 web                # Health computer API endpoint (http://localhost:9615)
```

## Different ways to launch a process

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js -i max  # Will start maximum processes depending on CPU availables
$ pm2 start app.js -i 3    # Will start 3 processes
$ pm2 start app.js --name serverone # Start a process an name it as server one
                                    # you can now stop the process by doing
                                    # pm2 stop serverone
$ pm2 start app.json       # Start processes with options declared in app.json
                           # Go to chapter Multi process JSON declaration for more
                           
$ pm2 start app.js -c "* * * * * *" # Will restart the process depending on the
                                    # cron pattern. Here it will restart the process
                                    # every second

$ pm2 start app.js -i max -- -a 23  # Pass arguments after -- to app.js
$ pm2 start app.js -i max -e err.log -o out.log -w  # Will start and generate a configuration file
```

## Is my production server ready for PM2 ?

Just try the tests before using PM2 on your production server

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Unitech/pm2.git
$ cd pm2
$ npm install  # Or do npm install --dev if devDependencies are not installed
$ npm test
```

If a test is broken please report us issues [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues?state=open)

## Hot code reload (0s downtime)

This feature permits to reload code without loosing current processed queries.
**ONLY FOR NETWORKED APPLICATIONS**

```
$ pm2 reload all
```

## CoffeeScript

```bash
$ pm2 start my_app.coffee
```

That's all !

<a name="a5"/>
## Updating pm2 and resurrecting process

```bash
$ pm2 dump
$ npm install -g pm2@latest
$ pm2 kill ; pm2 resurrect
```

## How to install the pm2 master branch

```bash
npm install git://github.com/Unitech/pm2.git -g
```

<a name="a6"/>
## pm2 list

List infos about all processes managed by pm2. It shows also how many times a process has been restarted because of an unhandled exception.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-list.png)

<a name="a7"/>
## pm2 monit

Monitor CPU and memory usage of every node process (and also clustered processes) managed by pm2.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-monit.png)

<a name="a8"/>
## pm2 automatic startup script generation

PM2 provides an automatic way to keep Node processes alive. It uses an init script (compatible with most Linux systems).

```bash
$ pm2 startup
```

Now you can reboot your server, and already launched processes should be kepts alive ;)

<a name="a9"/>
## pm2 logs

Display logs in streaming of all processes, without having to do a tail -f or something else.
You can also pass [name|id] as parameter to stream only the log of a specified process.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-logs.png)

<a name="a10"/>
## pm2 dump/resurrect

You can dump all currently running processes, including their environment and execution path.
After restarting or stopping PM2 you can `resurrect` them. 

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-resurect.png)

## pm2 cron restart

The `-c "cron_pattern"` option permits to hard restart a process scheduled on the cron pattern.
Look at test/cli.sh for examples.

<a name="a12"/>
## pm2 health web api endpoint

PM2 can disserve an API endpoint to monitor processes and computer health (cpu usage, memory, network interfaces...)

```
pm2 web
```

<a name="a13"/>
# Multi process JSON declaration

processes.json : 

```json
[{
  "name"      : "echo",
  "script"    : "./examples/args.js",
  "instances" : "1",
  "args"      : "['--toto=heya coco', '-d', '1']",
  "cron_restart" : "* * * * * *"
},{
    "name"      : "api",
    "script"    : "./examples/child.js",
    "instances" : "4",
    "fileError" : "./examples/child-err.log",
    "fileOutput" : "./examples/child-out.log"
},{
  "min_uptime" : "100",
  "max_restarts" : "400",
  "name" : "auto-kill",
  "script" : "./examples/killfast.js"
}]
```

Then with the cli :
```bash
$ pm2 start processes.json
```

### Special options with JSON process declaration

- "min_uptime":
if a process is restarted with an uptime smaller than this value,
this restart counts as an unstable restart. If this option is not specified,
all restarts are considered unstable.

- "max_restarts":
if the number of unstable restarts exceeds this number,
the process will be stopped and a message with number with restarts will be logged.

# MISC

## Features

- Clusterize your Node networked script without adding one line of code
- Fully tested
- Monitor process/cluster processes health (status, memory, cpu usage, restarted time) via CLI (htop like)
- Monitor server health (processes, cpu core...) via JSON api (pm2 web)
- Launch multiple applications via JSON
- Forever keep alive processes
- Log streaming in realtime (pm2 logs)
- Log uncaught exceptions in error logs
- Track restarted time
- Auto stop processes who exit too fast
- Dump current processes and resurrect (upstart)


## Next Features/Ideas

- Remote administration/status checking
- Builtin Inter process communication channel (message bus)
- Auto start of the script at start (upstart)
- V8 GC memory leak detection
- Web interface
- Keeping monitoring data
- Integrated wrk utils endpoint benchmark

## Install a process (draft, not implemented)

You can install processes and communicate with them
```bash
$ m2 install web-pm2
$ m2 list
$ m2 start web-pm2
$ m2 info web-pm2  # list 
```

- Add homogen communication channel (pubsub/eventemitter2 - wildcard events) (axon pub/sub-message.js)
